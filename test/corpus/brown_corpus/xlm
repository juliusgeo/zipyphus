their department chairmen to promote their interests with the administration. 
The administration at the same time, looks to the chairmen 
for strategic aid in building stronger departments. One way that this 
can be done, other than by hiring new high-priced professors, is by constantly 
encouraging the department members to raise their standards 
of performance.   The quality of a president's leadership is 
measured first by his success in building up the faculty. By supporting 
the efforts of the many faculty members who are working to attain ever 
higher standards, the president can encourage faculty leadership. 
Indirectly he can best help them by insuring that rigorous criteria for 
appointment and promotion are clearly set forth and adhered to.

The academic dean should take a direct, long-term interest in faculty 
development. An alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel 
needs, plans for the future, qualifications of those on the job, 
and bright prospects elsewhere.   For the maintenance of a long-term 
program, the departments, and particularly their chairmen, are 
strategic. They evaluate and nominate candidates for appointment and 
promotion. To provide an independent judgment for the president, the 
academic dean also investigates candidates thoroughly.   At some 
colleges and universities, a faculty committee reviews and reports 
to the administration on the qualifications of candidates. Some faculty 
members and many administrators oppose faculty review groups because 
they either repeat department's actions or act <pro forma>. They 
can be effective, however, if their members set high standards for candidates 
and devote substantial time to the work. At one university, 
the president cites the faculty review committee as "a valued partner 
of the administration in guarding and promoting the quality of the 
faculty".   Before the president recommends a candidate to the 
trustees, the administration collects the views of colleagues in the 
same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere. The president or dean 
reads some of his publications to form the truest possible evaluation 
of the quality of his mind. No good way to evaluate teaching ability 
has yet been discovered, although some institutions use inventory sheets 
for a list of criteria. To avoid passing over quiet, unaggressive 
teachers as well as to decide whether others merit promotion, review 
of the right of faculty members to promotion or salary increases should 
be made periodically whether or not they have been recommended for 
advancement by their departments.   There are certain aspects of 
personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly. 
He should personally consider the potential of a faculty member 
proposed for tenure, to guard against the mistake of making this profoundly 
serious commitment turn solely upon the man's former achievements. 
No one can be as effective as the president in inspiring older 
men to welcome imaginative new teachers whose philosophy or approach to 
their specialties is quite different. In particular, the president 
may have to summon all his oratorical powers to persuade department members 
to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale. On 
those rare occasions when a faculty member on tenure is not meeting the 
standards of the institution, the president must also bear the ultimate 
burden of decision and action. ##

<A true university, like most 
successful marriages, is a unity of diversities **h Without forcing 
all components into a single pattern, the preparation of a master plan 
is an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at its highest 
level, which a university- in contrast to a multiversity- should 
stand for>.   Recently colleges and universities have begun 
to translate their educational philosophy into institution-wide goals. 
Each year a few more institutions are deciding such questions as: 
Shall we require a liberal education built around a humanities core 
for all undergraduates? Or shall we permit early specialization in 
scientific and technological subjects? In the first instance, adequate 
appropriate reading materials and library accommodations must be 
planned. In the second, more shops, laboratories, and staff will be required.

For the president, a master plan looking ahead five years 
(the maximum reach for sound forecasting), offers several practical 
advantages. Trustees, faculty, and administration can consider the 
consequences of decisions before they are made, instead of afterwards. 
Physical plant and equipment can be efficiently developed. Proposed 
new programs can be examined for appropriateness to goals and for present 
and future financial fitness. More than one president has found 
that a long-range plan helps him to attract major gifts. It inspires 
confidence in his institution's determination to establish goals and 
to achieve them.   Before deciding where it is going, however, 
a college 
or university must know where it is. The first step is a comprehensive 
self study made by faculty, by outside consultants, or by a combination 
of the two. It should sternly appraise curricula, faculty, organization, 
buildings, faculty work loads, and potential for growth in 
stature and size.   Implementation of the master plan will inevitably 
be uneven. Some departments will attack their new goals enthusiastically; 
others may drag their feet. Funds may be readily donated 
for some purposes but not others. A plan must therefore be brought 
up to date periodically, possibly with the assistance of a permanent 
planning officer.   To provide the continuous flow of information 
basic to administrative decisions, a number of institutions have established 
offices of institutional research. Some offices have very broad 
responsibilities, touching on almost all aspects of a university's 
instructional program. Their duties include evaluation of the information 
collected and preparation of recommendations. More often, these 
offices are restricted to the gathering of empirical data. ## 
**h <the president's opportunity for influencing education reaches 
its highest point, as he decides which projects he will cut back, which 
he will advance by increased allowances or new fund-raising efforts>.

No matter how high the hopes and dreams of educators, budget 
making adjusts them to the cold realities of dollars and cents. When 
the budget goes to trustees for approval it is the president's budget, 
to which his faith and credit are committed; its principal features 
should be a product of his most considered judgment. He cannot, 
of course, examine each proposal from scratch. He reviews and shapes 
the work of others to mold a single joint product that will best promote 
the aims of the institution.   Budgeting must be flexible to 
allow adaptation to the rapid changes in scientific and technological 
scholarship. Because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly 
large sums of money, an institution should choose its fields 
of prominence. Otherwise it will be headed for bankruptcy, at worst, 
and at best towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and 
culturally indispensable branches of learning. In the national interest 
even the affluent universities must consider some division of labor 
among them to replace their present ambitions to keep up with the Joneses 
in all branches. ##

<Supporting activities- business 
management, public relations, fund-raising- offer presidents one of 
their best chances to buy freedom for attention to education **h Here 
the reasonable mastery of the elements of administration can do much 
to free a president for his primary role>.   In the areas that 
do 
not relate directly to the educational program, expert subordinates will 
serve the college or university better than close presidential attention. 
The president should find strong subordinates and delegate the 
widest discretion to them. Higher education cannot compete with the 
salary scales of the business world, but an educational institution can 
offer many potent intangible attractions to members of the business 
community that will offset the differences in income.   Just as 
the entire faculty should know the president's educational philosophy 
and objectives, so should non-academic officers. They will better 
understand the relationship of their activities to the academic program 
and they will be able to explain their actions to faculty in terms of 
mutual goals.   A president is frequently besieged to serve in 
non-academic civic and governmental capacities, to make speeches to lay 
groups, and to make numerous ceremonial appearances on and off campus. 
Since he can neither accept nor reject them all, he must be governed 
by the time and energy available for his prime professional obligations. 
Declinations and substitutions are better received when he explains 
why his obligations to his institution preclude his acceptance.

By sharing the load of important speeches with his colleagues, 
the president can develop a cadre of able spokesmen who will help to 
create a public perception of the university as an institution, something 
more than the lengthened shadow of one man. 

#1. INTRODUCTION#

IT HAS recently become practical to use the 
radio emission of the moon and planets as a new source of information 
about these bodies and their atmospheres. The results of present observations 
of the thermal radio emission of the moon are consistent with 
the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which was derived 
from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipses (e&g&, 
Garstung, 1958). When sufficiently accurate and complete measurements 
are available, it will be possible to set limits on the thermal 
and electrical characteristics of the surface and subsurface materials 
of the moon.   Observations of the radio emission of a planet 
which has an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a greater 
extent than those using shorter wave lengths and should in some cases 
give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristics 
of the solid surface. Radio observations of Venus and Jupiter have 
already supplied unexpected experimental data on the physical conditions 
of these planets. The observed intensity of the radio emission of 
Venus is much higher than the expected thermal intensity, although the 
spectrum indicated by measurements at wave lengths near 3 ~cm and 
1o ~cm is like that of a black body at about 6oo` ~K. This result 
suggests a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet, 
although there is the possibility that the observed radiation may be 
a combination of both thermal and non-thermal components and that the 
observed spectrum is that of a black body merely by coincidence. For 
the case of Jupiter, the radio emission spectrum is definitely not like 
the spectrum of a black-body radiator, and it seems very likely that 
the radiation reaching the earth is a combination of thermal radiation 
from the atmosphere and non-thermal components.   Of the remaining 
planets, only Mars and Saturn have been observed as radio sources, 
and not very much information is available. Mars has been observed 
twice at about 3-~cm wave length, and the intensity of the observed 
radiation is in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which 
might be predicted on the basis of the known temperature of Mars. 
The low intensity of the radiation from Saturn has limited observations, 
but again the measured radiation seems to be consistent with a thermal 
origin. No attempts to measure the radio emission of the remaining 
planets have been reported, and, because of their distances, small 
diameters, or low temperatures, the thermal radiation at radio wave lengths 
reaching the earth from these sources is expected to be of very 
low intensity. In spite of this, the very large radio reflectors and 
improved amplifying techniques which are now becoming available should 
make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planets 
in a few years.   The study of the radio emission of the moon 
and planets began with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon 
at 1.25-~cm wave length by Dicke and Beringer (1946). This was 
followed by a comprehensive series of observations of the 1.25-~cm 
emission of the moon over three lunar cycles by Piddington and Minnett 
(1949). They deduced from their measurements that the radio emission 
from the whole disk of the moon varied during a lunation in a roughly 
sinusoidal fashion; that the amplitude of the variation was considerably 
less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission 
as measured by Pettit and Nicholson (1930) and Pettit (1935); 
and that the maximum of the radio emission came about 3-1/2 days after
