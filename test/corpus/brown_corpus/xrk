"I'd like to know just which it is that those guys don't 
understand, the liquor or automobiles". Somehow the thought of a simple 
man bewildered by things no one had ever really helped him understand 
moved the driver. For a moment his hatred toward drunken or careless 
drivers softened. Maybe the Indian wasn't too much at fault, 
Ramey thought. Maybe he was only doing the best he knew how, like any 
of us. Anyway, he doesn't deserve to lie there in the sun and be 
stared at.   "Ever see yourself spread out on the pavement, Benny"? 
he said to his partner.   "You mean dream"?

"Not exactly. Just see it". Benson grinned and flipped a rock 
with his thumb like a marble.   "Nope, just you, all the time- 
sometimes I think it's the only way I'll ever get a decent 
partner".   Ramey smiled but he thought to himself, I always 
see me too. Never Benny. Whenever he saw someone lying in the dirt, 
Ramey wondered what the person had been thinking and he would try out 
thoughts in his own mind. Then he would realize they were really things 
that only he himself could think. With this realization, sometimes, 
he saw himself as he looked down.   "You seen him yet"? 
Benson said, referring to the Indian.   "He wasn't in the 
car", Ramey said.   "You didn't go clear around", Benson 
said. "If you want to see something, he's back on the other 
side by the trunk of the car".   "Too long a waiting line", 
Ramey answered, pretending to joke.   A few minutes later the 
insurance man, a road checker, drove up in the gray coupe with license 
plates on it from a far-away state. It was a trick they used to try 
and conceal their identity when they followed trucks to check their 
speed. 
Sometimes they just parked at the side of the road and used radar 
on the trucks as they passed. All the drivers knew about the plates 
and they also knew about the big floppy straw hat with shredded edges, 
the kind natives in travel ads wear when they are out joyfully chopping 
cane. Horsely, an agent on the east end, wore the hat, trying to 
look like a tourist. It had always seemed strange to Ramey that to 
disguise himself as a tourist, an ex-truck driver like Horsely would 
merely pick something outlandish and put it on his head.   The insurance 
man informed them that he had talked to Crumley who was all 
right and that he would watch the men's personal effects until they 
towed the rig back to town. He chatted with Ramey and Benson for a 
minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer. Every so often the 
diminishing sound of a car came under the trailer as it slowed down for 
the wreck then speeded up again as it got clear.   When they 
were ready to leave, Benson and Ramey walked back around the rear of 
the trailer.   "There's a body you won't mind looking at", 
Benson said and they stopped. She had driven up with her husband 
in a convertible with Eastern license plates, although the two drivers 
knew nothing at the moment about that. She wore shorts and a loose 
terry-cloth shirt. Slender and tanned, her dark brown hair was drawn 
straight back, simply.   "What outfit does she drive for"? 
Benson said.   Seeing her caused a lurch in Ramey, a recognition. 
She might have been someone he had once loved. He had never seen 
her before, but now he thought of the manner in which he and Benson 
went in and out of the cities, at each end of their run. The truck 
routes, the industrial areas with walls grimed with diesel smoke passed 
briefly through his mind- back alleys were their access to a city 
and they could never stay. How would you ever see her again? The feeling 
subsided, it was only a small yearning. Their work was lonely.

"What's she doing in this bunch"? Benson said, and Ramey 
wondered how close their thoughts might have been.   The girl 
looked around at the countryside. Her glance swung past the trailer 
where the two drivers were standing. It made only a tiny bump over 
the two 
men like a tire over a piece of gravel then moved on. She began 
to watch a blonde-haired man, also in shorts, standing right at the rear 
of the wrecked car in the one spot that most of the crowd had detoured 
slightly. What had caught his attention was obscured by the car 
itself, so that neither the girl nor the truck drivers could see, but 
Benson knew what it was. The girl took a couple of steps toward the 
man in shorts when Benson, in that barefoot courtliness Ramey could 
never decide was real, said, "You don't want to go around there, 
Ma'am". The girl stopped but did not turn her head or acknowledge 
that someone had spoken to her.   The man stood near the bent 
levi-clad body of the Indian who lay face down almost under the car. 
The two drivers moved closer.   "What does he want, a spoon"? 
Benson said to Ramey.   One tiny detail in a happening can 
clog the memory and stick like meat in a crooked tooth, while the rest 
of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain. With Ramey it was 
a dusty work shoe that was half-off the Indian's foot that he would 
always remember. The laces were broken at the bottom of the eyelets 
but there was still a bow knot at the top. The slightest twitch would 
have parted the shoe entirely from the foot, yet the toes were still 
inside.   The two men in overalls stood just behind the blonde-headed 
man. He wore tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red ~V 
at the neck, the sleeves pushed above the elbows. He turned and looked 
at them with clear blue eyes, immaculate eyes. He was very tanned- 
big hands might have torn him from a Coca-Cola poster.   "He's 
dead, isn't he"? the man said. He turned and bent over 
the body of the Indian. There was nothing in particular on the man's 
face. It was simply a matter of curiosity, a natural right to examine.

"What's this"? the man said, backing up a step, 
still looking down. His words were mostly to himself.   "Don't". 
There was a gentle concern in Benson's voice. Ramey looked 
down and saw the white sneaker at the bottom of the man's tanned 
leg cautiously nudge a bit of folded, blood-flecked substance lying by 
itself on the pavement.   "But what is it"? the man said 
with a tone of impatience.   <But what is it?> The man had 
spoken only once. Ramey heard the words again inside, weakened, the 
way moving water sounds through a grove of trees, until he was not sure 
whether it was sound or light-headedness pressing in his ears.

The sneaker reached out once more to tap against the mass and Ramey's 
vision darkened except for an unreasonable clarity of the man's 
leg. Ramey saw sunlight touch the curly blonde hairs on the brown 
skin. He stared at the shining, shining circles of hairs and heard the 
voice of his partner through trees, "Don't do that, fella. Them's 
brains".   The man seemed to sink a little as Ramey brought 
the tire iron down on his shoulder and it seemed that the blonde 
head was turning as he hit the man again, with his fist. Ramey swung 
and caught the man just to the left of his mouth. It was a straight, 
solid, once-in-a-lifetime shot; he laid all four knuckles in between 
the man's cheekbone and his chin. Ramey's fist and the air expelled 
from the man's collapsing cheek made a hollow pop in the air like 
cupped hands clapping together.   The man took two short steps 
backward then sat down heavily on the pavement. Ramey heard a cry from 
the girl and felt a slight pain somewhere in his hand. As he watched 
the man sit suddenly, a detached part of his mind observed how very 
difficult it was, really, to knock a man off his feet. He hadn't 
done it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard. 
With a thoughtful look, the man sat on the pavement, legs straight out 
in front of him. His arms hung like empty shirt sleeves, and his mouth 
was slightly open. After what seemed several seconds, the open mouth 
grew dark inside then blood began to ooze from it. The man brought 
one hand up slowly and the fingers fumbled across his face until he 
touched his mouth. He moaned and pulled the hand away. Even yet there 
was no realization in his eyes.   Ramey could hear the crowd 
coming up rapidly behind him and the questioning voices coming over his 
shoulder had no identity or importance to him. He did not look around.

"What happened"? someone said.   "He's hurt"! 
A woman's voice said, and then he heard a sort of wail from 
the man's wife. The man on the ground began to move; one of his 
hands flattened out on the pavement and supported him. Blood dripped 
down the front of his sweater, soaking into a dark streak of dirt that 
ran diagonally across the white wool on his shoulder, as though the 
bright ~V woven into the neckline had melted, running a darker color.

The girl kneeled by her husband with one arm at his back. 
"Can you hear, can you talk to me"? she begged. An incoherent, 
puzzled sound came from the red mouth. The girl looked around quickly 
at several of the people. None of the crowd had stepped forward to 
help. Then she saw Ramey and her face was misshapen with bewilderment.

"Why did you do it- why did you hit him"? she said, 
her voice rising. Ramey said nothing. A shine in her eyes suddenly 
became tears and she turned back to her husband again.   Behind 
Ramey feet scraped beneath sharp questioning whispers. No one seemed 
to know for sure what had happened, nor was there any purpose or responsibility 
in the muttering feet and urgent voices behind the driver, 
beyond finding out.   Ramey looked around and caught sight of his 
partner near the front end of the wrecked truck talking to the patrolman. 
Benson moved his arms, gesturing with an unfamiliar vigor and 
talking rapidly. Ramey caught a glimpse of the insurance man. Some of 
the ruddiness was gone from his face and he stared at Ramey. It's 
all over now, the driver thought as he saw the patrolman turn and walk 
rapidly down along the trailer toward them. Ramey watched him coming 
with a vision as clean as the glare on the metal sides of the trailer. 
He saw the dark sweat spots flip in and out of sight under the patrolman's 
swinging arms and in the leather holster that swaggered and 
rolled at the side of his stocky body, the sun left a smoky shine on 
the narrow strip of blue metal that ran between the horned handles of 
his pistol.   "All right, step back"! the patrolman said 
to no one in particular as he pushed between the fat man in the baseball 
cap and a young boy in levis. He walked straight up to the man sitting 
on the ground and bent over to look at him.   "You all right"?

"Mough- it's my mough", the man said, trying 
to talk without moving his lips. His brown face looked gray from dirt 
streaks where his hand had come off the dusty pavement and rubbed across 
it. 
Then he calmly and carefully slugged the remaining five shots into the 
venomous head- caught in the wicker back of the chair, the eyes dead 
on him as the life finally went out of the brute. The body continued 
to lash, but now Keith used the legs of the chair to fork the loathsome, 
bloody mass out of the bungalow. He slammed the door and listened 
as his servants ran up, alarmed at the sound of the shots. He heard 
their chattering, and then the sounds of hacking as they dismembered 
the snake right on the porch with wood axes.   It was only then 
that he turned to look at Penny.   She was sitting on the edge 
of the bed again, back in the same position where the snake had found 
her. The fear had not entirely gone from her face, but there were some 
other emotions now, crowding into her eyes and the lines of her mouth.

But her hands were calm, now. <She's got guts,> thought 
Keith. <She's got more guts than any other woman in the world>.

"Keith", said Penny, "Keith, you were wonderful. I 
don't suppose a wife should be grateful to her husband for saving 
her life, but I am. Thank you, Keith".   He smiled at her 
sincerity. And for the hundredth time that week, he was startled at her 
beauty. Strange. Seven years they'd been married. He knew her 
mind pretty well, by now, its quick perceptions and sympathies, its painful 
insistence on truth and directness, its capacity for love almost 
too deep for a man to reciprocate, even in part. But her beauty always 
surprised him anew.   "I realize that this is hardly the time 
to say it, Penny", said Keith. "But knowing you, I know that 
you're glad to be alive, and grateful- and sorry because I killed 
the snake, even though I had to. Isn't that so"?   Penny 
lowered her eyes.   "Yes", she said, almost in a whisper,
