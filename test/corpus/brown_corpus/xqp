Eileen Farrell, Elvis Presley and Geraldine Todd, as well 
as the curious rhythmic progressions of the Venusians, Capellan visual 
chromatics and the sonic concerti of the Altairians. But "singing" 
for any shell person posed considerable technical difficulties 
to be overcome. Shell people were schooled to examine every aspect of 
a problem or situation before making a prognosis. Balanced properly 
between optimism and practicality, the nondefeatist attitude of the shell 
people led them to extricate themselves, their ships and personnel, 
from bizarre situations. Therefore to Helva, the problem that she 
couldn't open her mouth to sing, among other restrictions, did not 
bother her. She would work out a method, by-passing her limitations, 
whereby she could sing.   She approached the problem by investigating 
the methods of sound reproduction through the centuries, human and 
instrumental. Her own sound production equipment was essentially more 
instrumental than vocal. Breath control and the proper enunciation 
of vowel sounds within the oral cavity appeared to require the most 
development and practice. Shell people did not, strictly speaking, breathe. 
For their purposes, oxygen and other gases were not drawn from 
the surrounding atmosphere through the medium of lungs but sustained 
artificially by solution in their shells. After experimentation, Helva 
discovered that she could manipulate her diaphragmic unit to sustain 
tone. By relaxing the throat muscles and expanding the oral cavity 
well into the frontal sinuses, she could direct the vowel sounds into 
the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through her throat 
microphone. She compared the results with tape recordings of modern 
singers and was not unpleased although her own tapes had a peculiar 
quality about them, not at all unharmonious, merely unique. Acquiring 
a repertoire from the Laboratory library was no problem to one trained 
to perfect recall. She found herself able to sing any role and any 
song which struck her fancy. It would not have occurred to her that 
it was curious for a female to sing bass, baritone, tenor, alto, mezzo, 
soprano and coloratura as she pleased. It was, to Helva, only a matter 
of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control required by the 
music attempted.   If the authorities remarked on her curious 
avocation, they did so among themselves. Shell people were encouraged 
to develop a hobby so long as they maintained proficiency in their technical 
work.   On the anniversary of her sixteenth year in her 
shell, Helva was unconditionally graduated and installed in her ship, 
the ~XH-834. Her permanent titanium shell was recessed behind an 
even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship. 
The neural, audio, visual and sensory connections were made and 
sealed. Her extendibles were diverted, connected or augmented and the 
final, delicate-beyond-description brain taps were completed while Helva 
remained anesthetically unaware of the proceedings. When she awoke, 
she <was> the ship. Her brain and intelligence controlled every 
function from navigation to such loading as a scout ship of her class 
needed. She could take care of herself and her ambulatory half, in any 
situation already recorded in the annals of Central Worlds and any 
situation its most fertile minds could imagine.   Her first actual 
flight, for she and her kind had made mock flights on dummy panels 
since she was eight, showed her complete mastery of the techniques 
of her profession. She was ready for her great adventures and the arrival 
of her mobile partner.   There were nine qualified scouts sitting 
around collecting base pay the day Helva was commissioned. There 
were several missions which demanded instant attention but Helva 
had been of interest to several department heads in Central for some 
time and each man was determined to have her assigned to <his> section. 
Consequently no one had remembered to introduce Helva to the prospective 
partners. The ship always chose its own partner. Had there 
been another "brain" ship at the Base at the moment, Helva would 
have been guided to make the first move. As it was, while Central wrangled 
among itself, Robert Tanner sneaked out of the pilots' barracks, 
out to the field and over to Helva's slim metal hull. 
"Hello, anyone at home"? Tanner wisecracked.   "Of course", 
replied Helva logically, activating her outside scanners. "Are 
you my partner"? she asked hopefully, as she recognized the 
Scout Service uniform.   "All you have to do is ask", he retorted 
hopefully.   "No one has come. I thought perhaps there 
were no partners available and I've had no directives from Central".

Even to herself Helva sounded a little self-pitying but 
the truth was she was lonely, sitting on the darkened field. Always 
she had had the company of other shells and more recently, technicians 
by the score. The sudden solitude had lost its momentary charm and 
become oppressive.   "No directives from Central is scarcely 
a cause for regret, but there happen to be eight other guys biting their 
fingernails to the quick just waiting for an invitation to board you, 
you beautiful thing". 
It would have killed you in the cabin. Do you have anything for me"?

Mercer stammered, not knowing what B'dikkat meant, and 
the two-nosed man answered for him, "I think he has a nice baby head, 
but it isn't big enough for you to take yet".   Mercer never 
noticed the needle touch his arm.   B'dikkat had turned to 
the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit Mercer. 
He tried to run after B'dikkat, to hug the lead spacesuit, to tell 
B'dikkat that he loved him. He stumbled and fell, but it did not 
hurt.   The many-bodied girl lay near him. Mercer spoke to her.

"Isn't it wonderful? You're beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. 
I'm so happy to be here".   The woman covered with 
growing hands came and sat beside them. She radiated warmth and good 
fellowship. Mercer thought that she looked very distinguished and charming. 
He struggled out of his clothes. It was foolish and snobbish 
to wear clothing when none of these nice people did.   The two 
women babbled and crooned at him.   With one corner of his mind 
he knew that they were saying nothing, just expressing the euphoria of 
a drug so powerful that the known universe had forbidden it. With most 
of his mind he was happy. He wondered how anyone could have the good 
luck to visit a planet as nice as this. He tried to tell the Lady 
Da, but the words weren't quite straight.   A painful stab 
hit him in the abdomen. The drug went after the pain and swallowed it. 
It was like the cap in the hospital, only a thousand times better. 
The pain was gone, though it had been crippling the first time.

He forced himself to be deliberate. He rammed his mind into focus 
and said to the two ladies who lay pinkly nude beside him in the desert, 
"That was a good bite. Maybe I will grow another head. That 
would make B'dikkat happy"!   The Lady Da forced the foremost 
of her bodies in an upright position. Said she, "I'm strong, 
too. I can talk. Remember, man, remember. People never live forever. 
We can die, too, we can die like real people. I do so believe 
in death"!   Mercer smiled at her through his happiness.

"Of course you can. But isn't this nice **h"   With 
this he felt his lips thicken and his mind go slack. He was wide awake, 
but he did not feel like doing anything. In that beautiful place, 
among all those companionable and attractive people, he sat and smiled.

B'dikkat was sterilizing his knives. ##

Mercer wondered 
how long the super-condamine had lasted him. He endured the ministrations 
of the dromozoa without screams or movement. The agonies of nerves 
and itching of skin were phenomena which happened somewhere near 
him, but meant nothing. He watched his own body with remote, casual 
interest. 
The Lady Da and the hand-covered woman stayed near him. After 
a long time the half-man dragged himself over to the group with his 
powerful arms. Having arrived he blinked sleepily and friendlily at 
them, and lapsed back into the restful stupor from which he had emerged. 
Mercer saw the sun rise on occasion, closed his eyes briefly, and 
opened them to see stars shining. Time had no meaning. The dromozoa 
fed him in their mysterious way; the drug canceled out his needs for 
cycles of the body.   At last he noticed a return of the inwardness 
of pain.   The pains themselves had not changed; he had.

He knew all the events which could take place on Shayol. He 
remembered them well from his happy period. Formerly he had noticed 
them- now he felt them.   He tried to ask the Lady Da how long 
they had had the drug, and how much longer they would have to wait 
before they had it again. She smiled at him with benign, remote happiness; 
apparently her many torsos, stretched out along the ground, had 
a greater capacity for retaining the drug than did his body. She meant 
him well, but was in no condition for articulate speech.   The 
half-man lay on the ground, arteries pulsating prettily behind the 
half-transparent film which protected his abdominal cavity.   Mercer 
squeezed the man's shoulder.   The half-man woke, recognized 
Mercer and gave him a healthily sleepy grin.   "'A good 
morrow to you, my boy'. That's out of a play. Did you ever see 
a play"?   "You mean a game with cards"?   "No", 
said the half-man, "a sort of eye-machine with real people doing 
the figures".   "I never saw that", said Mercer, "but 
I"-   "But you want to ask me when B'dikkat is going 
to come back with the needle".   "Yes", said Mercer, a little 
ashamed of his obviousness.   "Soon", said the half-man. 
That's why I think of plays. We all know what is going to happen. 
We all know when it is going to happen. We all know what the dummies 
will do"- he gestured at the hummocks in which the decorticated 
men were cradled- "and we all know what the new people will ask. 
But we never know how long a scene is going to take".   "What's 
a 'scene'"? asked Mercer. "Is that the name for the 
needle"?   The half-man laughed with something close to real 
humor. "No, no, no. You've got the lovelies on the brain. A 
scene is just a part of a play. I mean we know the order in which things 
happen, but we have no clocks and nobody cares enough to count days 
or to make calendars and there's not much climate here, so none of 
us know how long anything takes. The pain seems short and the pleasure 
seems long. I'm inclined to think that they are about two Earth-weeks 
each".   Mercer did not know what an "Earth-week" 
was, since he had not been a well-read man before his conviction, but 
he got nothing more from the half-man at that time. The half-man received 
a dromozootic implant, turned red in the face, shouted senselessly 
at Mercer, "Take it out, you fool! Take it out of me"!

When Mercer looked on helplessly, the half-man twisted over on 
his side, his pink dusty back turned to Mercer, and wept hoarsely and 
quietly to himself.   Mercer himself could not tell how long it 
was before B'dikkat came back. It might have been several days. 
It might have been several months.   Once again B'dikkat moved 
among them like a father; once again they clustered like children. 
This time B'dikkat smiled pleasantly at the little head which had 
grown out of Mercer's thigh- a sleeping child's head, covered 
with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrows over the resting eyes. 
Mercer got the blissful needle.   When B'dikkat cut the head 
from Mercer's thigh, he felt the knife grinding against the cartilage 
which held the head 
to his own body. He saw the child-face grimace 
as the head was cut; he felt the far, cool flash of unimportant pain, 
as B'dikkat dabbed the wound with a corrosive antiseptic which 
stopped all bleeding immediately.   The next time it was two legs 
growing from his chest.   Then there had been another head beside 
his own.   Or was that after the torso and legs, waist to toe-tips, 
of the little girl which had grown from his side?   He 
forgot the order.   He did not count time.   Lady Da smiled 
at him often, but there was no love in this place. She had lost 
the extra torsos. In between teratologies, she was a pretty and shapely 
woman; but the nicest thing about their relationship was her whisper 
to him, repeated some thousands of time, repeated with smiles and 
hope, "People never live forever".   She found this immensely
