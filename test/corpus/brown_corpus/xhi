children he has known and loved, perhaps even of his own children. He 
knows that he certainly does not want <his> children living this 
way. He can retreat from his uneasiness in only one direction: into 
a callousness which very shortly becomes second nature. He becomes more 
callous, the population becomes more hostile, the situation grows 
more tense, and the police force is increased. One day, to everyone's 
astonishment, someone drops a match in the powder keg and everything 
blows up. Before the dust has settled or the blood congealed, editorials, 
speeches, and civil-rights commissions are loud in the land, demanding 
to know what happened. What happened is that Negroes want to 
be treated like men.   <Negroes want to be treated like men:> 
a perfectly straightforward statement, containing only seven words. 
People who have mastered Kant, Hegel, Shakespeare, Marx, Freud, 
and the Bible find this statement utterly impenetrable. The idea seems 
to threaten profound, barely conscious assumptions. A kind of panic 
paralyzes their features, as though they found themselves trapped on 
the edge of a steep place. I once tried to describe to a very well-known 
American intellectual the conditions among Negroes in the South. 
My recital disturbed him and made him indignant; and he asked me 
in perfect innocence, "Why don't all the Negroes in the South 
move North"? I tried to explain what <has> happened, unfailingly, 
whenever a significant body of Negroes move North. They do not 
escape Jim Crow: they merely encounter another, not-less-deadly 
variety. They do not move to Chicago, they move to the South Side; 
they do not move to New York, they move to Harlem. The pressure 
within the ghetto causes the ghetto walls to expand, and this expansion 
is always violent. White people hold the line as long as they can, 
and in as many ways as they can, from verbal intimidation to physical 
violence. But inevitably the border which has divided the ghetto from 
the rest of the world falls into the hands of the ghetto. The white 
people fall back bitterly before the black horde; the landlords make 
a tidy profit by raising the rent, chopping up the rooms, and all but 
dispensing with the upkeep; and what has once been a neighborhood 
turns into a "turf". This is precisely what happened when the Puerto 
Ricans arrived in their thousands- and the bitterness thus caused 
is, as I write, being fought out all up and down those streets.

Northerners indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury. They seem 
to feel that because they fought on the right side during the Civil 
War, and won, they have earned the right merely to deplore what is going 
on in the South, without taking any responsibility for it; and 
that they can ignore what is happening in Northern cities because what 
is happening in Little Rock or Birmingham is worse. Well, in the 
first place, it is not possible for anyone who has not endured both 
to know which is "worse". I know Negroes who prefer the South and 
white Southerners, because "At least there, you haven't got to 
play any guessing games"! The guessing games referred to have driven 
more than one Negro into the narcotics ward, the madhouse, or the 
river. I know another Negro, a man very dear to me, who says, with 
conviction and with truth, "The spirit of the South is the spirit 
of America". He was born in the North and did his military training 
in the South. He did not, as far as I can gather, find the South 
"worse"; he found it, if anything, all too familiar. In the 
second place, though, even if Birmingham <is> worse, no doubt 
Johannesburg, South Africa, beats it by several miles, and Buchenwald 
was one of the worst things that ever happened in the entire history 
of the world. The world has never lacked for horrifying examples; 
but I do not believe that these examples are meant to be used as justification 
for our own crimes. This perpetual justification empties 
the heart of all human feeling. The emptier our hearts become, the greater 
will be our crimes. Thirdly, the South is not merely an embarrassingly 
backward region, but a part of this country, and what happens 
there concerns every one of us.   As far as the color problem 
is concerned, there is but one great difference between the Southern 
white and the Northerner: the Southerner remembers, historically and 
in his own psyche, a kind of Eden in which he loved black people and 
they loved him. Historically, the flaming sword laid across this Eden 
is the Civil War. Personally, it is the Southerner's sexual 
coming of age, when, without any warning, unbreakable taboos are set 
up between himself and his past. Everything, thereafter, is permitted 
him except the love he remembers and has never ceased to need. The resulting, 
indescribable torment affects every Southern mind and is the 
basis of the Southern hysteria.   None of this is true for the 
Northerner. Negroes represent nothing to him personally, except, perhaps, 
the dangers of carnality. He never sees Negroes. Southerners 
see them all the time. Northerners never think about them whereas Southerners 
are never really thinking of anything else. Negroes are, 
therefore, ignored in the North and are under surveillance in the South, 
and suffer hideously in both places. Neither the Southerner nor 
the Northerner is able to look on the Negro simply as a man. It seems 
to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the Negro be 
considered either as a kind of ward (in which case we are told how many 
Negroes, comparatively, bought Cadillacs last year and how few, 
comparatively, 
were lynched), or as a victim (in which case we are promised 
that he will never vote in our assemblies or go to school with our 
kids). They are two sides of the same coin and the South will not change- 
<cannot> change- until the North changes. The country will 
not change until it re-examines itself and discovers what it really 
means by freedom. In the meantime, generations keep being born, bitterness 
is increased by incompetence, pride, and folly, and the world shrinks 
around us.   It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one 
cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own: 
in the face of one's victim, one sees oneself. Walk through the 
streets of Harlem and see what we, this nation, have become. 

#4. EAST 
RIVER, DOWNTOWN: POSTSCRIPT TO A LETTER FROM HARLEM#
 
 THE 
FACT THAT AMERICAN NEgroes rioted in the U&N& while Adlai 
Stevenson was addressing the Assembly shocked and baffled most white 
Americans. Stevenson's speech, and the spectacular disturbance 
in the gallery, were both touched off by the death, in Katanga, the 
day before, of Patrice Lumumba. Stevenson stated, in the course of 
his address, that the United States was "against" colonialism. God 
knows what the African nations, who hold 25 per cent of the voting 
stock in the U&N& were thinking- they may, for example, have 
been thinking of the U&S& abstention when the vote on Algerian 
freedom was before the Assembly- but I think I have a fairly accurate 
notion of what the Negroes in the gallery were thinking. I had 
intended to be there myself. It was my first reaction upon hearing 
of Lumumba's death. I was curious about the impact of this political 
assassination on Negroes in Harlem, for Lumumba had- has- captured 
the popular imagination there. I was curious to know if Lumumba's 
death, which is surely among the most sinister of recent events, 
would elicit from "our" side anything more than the usual, well-meaning 
rhetoric. And I was curious about the African reaction.

However, the chaos on my desk prevented my being in the U&N& 
gallery. Had I been there, I, too, in the eyes of most Americans, 
would have been merely a pawn in the hands of the Communists. The 
climate and the events of the last decade, and the steady pressure of 
the "cold" war, have given Americans yet another means of avoiding 
self-examination, and so it has been decided that the riots were "Communist" 
inspired. Nor was it long, naturally, before prominent 
Negroes rushed forward to assure the republic that the U&N& rioters 
do not represent the real feeling of the Negro community. 
According, then, to what I take to be the prevailing view, these rioters 
were merely a handful of irresponsible, Stalinist-corrupted <provocateurs>.

I find this view amazing. It is a view which even 
a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict. One 
has only, for example, to walk through Harlem and ask oneself two questions. 
The first question is: Would <I> like to live here? 
And the second question is: Why don't those who now live here move 
out? The answer to both questions is immediately obvious. Unless 
one takes refuge in the theory- however disguised- that Negroes 
are, somehow, different from white people, I do not see how one can 
escape the conclusion that the Negro's status in this country is 
not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability.   Now, 
I do not doubt that, among the people at the U&N& that day, there 
were Stalinist and professional revolutionists acting out of the 
most cynical motives. Wherever there is great social discontent, these 
people are, sooner or later, to be found. Their presence is not as 
frightening as the discontent which creates their opportunity. What 
I find appalling- and really dangerous- is the American assumption 
that the Negro is so contented with his lot here that only the cynical 
agents of a foreign power can rouse him to protest. It is a notion 
which contains a gratuitous insult, implying, as it does, that Negroes 
can make no move unless they are manipulated. 
Color was delayed until 1935, the wide screen until the early fifties.

Movement itself was the chief and often the only attraction 
of the primitive movies of the nineties. Each film consisted of fifty 
feet, which gives a running time of about one minute on the screen. 
As long as audiences came to see the movement, there seemed little reason 
to adventure further. Motion-picture exhibitions took place in stores 
in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can 
still be found in such urban areas as Times Square. Brief snips of 
actual events were shown: parades, dances, street scenes. The sensational 
and frightening enjoyed popularity: a train rushes straight at 
the audience, or a great wave threatens to break over the seats. An 
early Edison production was <The Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots>. 
The unfortunate queen mounted the scaffold; the headsman swung 
his axe; the head dropped off; end of film. An early film by 
a competitor of the Wizard of Menlo Park simply showed a long kiss 
performed by two actors of the contemporary stage.   In the field 
of entertainment there is no spur to financial daring so effective 
as audience boredom, and the first decade of the new device was not over 
before audiences began staying away in large numbers from the simple-minded, 
one-minute shows. In response, the industry allowed the discovery 
of the motion picture as a form of fiction and thus gave the movies 
the essential form they have had to this day. Despite the sheer 
beauty and spectacle of numerous documentaries, art films, and travelogues, 
despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development 
as Cinerama, the movies are at heart a form of fiction, like the 
play, the novel, or the short story. Moreover, the most artistically 
successful of the nonfiction films have invariably borrowed the narrative 
form from the fiction feature. Thus such great American documentaries 
as <The River> and <The Plow That Broke the Plains> 
were composed as visual stories rather than as illustrated lectures. 
The discovery that movies are a form of fiction was made in the early 
years of this century and it was made chiefly by two men, a French 
magician, Georges Melies, and an American employee of Edison, Edwin 
S& Porter. Of the two, Porter is justly the better known, for 
he went far beyond the vital finding of fiction for films to take the 
first step toward fashioning a language of film, toward making the motion 
picture the intricate, efficient time machine that it has remained 
since, even in the most inept hands. 

#NARRATIVE TIME AND FILM TIME# 

Melies, however, out of his professional instincts as a magician, 
discovered and made use of a number of illusionary techniques that remain 
part of the vocabulary of film. One of these is the "dissolve", 
which makes possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene. 
As the first scene begins to fade, the succeeding scene begins 
to appear. For a moment or two, both scenes are present simultaneously, 
one growing weaker, one growing stronger. In a series of fairy tales
