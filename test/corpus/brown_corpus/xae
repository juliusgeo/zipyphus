on this score. His reply, he said, was that he agreed to the 
need for unity in the country now. But he further said that it was 
better politics to let others question the wisdom of administration policies 
first.   The Republicans some weeks ago served notice through 
Senator Thruston B& Morton (~R) of Kentucky, chairman 
of the Republican National Committee, that the Kennedy administration 
would be held responsible if the outcome in Laos was a coalition 
government susceptible of Communist domination.   Kennedy administration 
policies also have been assailed now from another direction 
by 70 Harvard, Boston University, Brandeis, and Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology educators. 

#DETENTE URGED#

This group pleads 
with the administration to "give no further support for the invasion 
of Cuba by exile groups". It recommends that the United States 
"seek instead to detach the Castro regime from the Communist bloc 
by working for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relations; 
and concentrate its constructive efforts on eliminating in other 
parts of Latin America the social conditions on which totalitarian 
nationalism feeds".   Mr& Nixon, for his part, would oppose 
intervention in Cuba without specific provocation. But he did recommend 
that President Kennedy state clearly that if Communist countries 
shipped any further arms to Cuba that it would not be tolerated.

Until the Cuban fiasco and the Communist military victories 
in Laos, 
almost any observer would have said that President Kennedy had blended 
a program that respected, generally, the opinions voiced both by 
Mr& Nixon and the professors. 

#AID PLANS REVAMPED#

Very early 
in his administration he informed the Kremlin through diplomatic channels, 
a high official source disclosed, that the new administration 
would react even tougher than the Eisenhower administration would during 
the formative period of the administration.   Strenuous efforts 
were made to remove pin pricking from administration statements. Policies 
on nuclear test ban negotiations were reviewed and changed. But 
thus far there has been no response in kind.   Foreign aid programs 
were revamped to give greater emphasis to economic aid and to 
encourage political reform in recipient nations.   In Laos, the 
administration looked at the Eisenhower administration efforts to show 
determination by sailing a naval fleet into Southeast Asian waters 
as a useless gesture.   Again and again it asked the Communists 
to "freeze" the military situation in Laos. But the Communists 
aided the Pathet Lao at an even faster rate.   And after several 
correspondents went into Pathet Lao territory and exposed the 
huge build-up, 
administration spokesmen acclaimed them for performing a 
"great service" and laid the matter before the Southeast Asia Treaty 
Organization.   ~SEATO was steamed up and prepared 
contingency plans for coping with the military losses in Laos. But 
the Communists never gave sufficient provocation at any one time for 
the United States to want to risk a limited or an all-out war over Laos. 
(Some ~SEATO nations disagreed, however.)   There 
was the further complication that the administration had very early concluded 
that Laos was ill suited to be an ally, unlike its more determined 
neighbors, Thailand and South Viet Nam.   The administration 
declared itself in favor of a neutralized Laos. The pro-Western 
government, which the United States had helped in a revolt against 
the Souvanna Phouma "neutralist" government, never did appear 
to spark much fighting spirit in the Royal Lao Army.   There 
certainly was not any more energy displayed after it was clear the United 
States would not back the pro-Western government to the hilt.

If the administration ever had any ideas that it could find an 
acceptable alternative to Prince Souvanna Phouma, whom it felt was 
too trusting of Communists, it gradually had to relinquish them.

One factor was the statement of Senator J& W& Fulbright (~D) 
of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
He declared on March 25 that the United States had erred a 
year and a half ago by "encouraging the removal" of Prince Souvanna. 
_WASHINGTON_ The White House is taking extraordinary steps to check 
the rapid growth of juvenile delinquency in the United States.

The President is deeply concerned over this problem and its effect 
upon the "vitality of the nation".   In an important assertion 
of national leadership in this field, he has issued an executive 
order establishing the President's committee on Juvenile Delinquency 
and Crime, to be supported and assisted by a Citizens Advisory 
Council of recognized authorities on juvenile problems.   The 
President asks the support and cooperation of Congress in his efforts 
through the enactment of legislation to provide federal grants to 
states for specified efforts in combating this disturbing crime trend. 

#OFFENSES MULTIPLY#

The President has also called upon the Attorney 
General, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, and 
the Secretary of Labor to coordinate their efforts "in the development 
of a program of federal leadership to assist states and local 
communities in their efforts to cope with the problem.   Simultaneously 
the President announced Thursday the appointment of David L& 
Hackett, a special assistant ot the Attorney General, as executive 
director of the new Committee on Juvenile Delinquency and Youth 
Crime.   His sense of urgency in this matter stems from the 
fact that court cases ond juvenile arrests have more than doubled since 
1948, each year showing an increase in offenders.   Among arrests 
reported by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 1959, about 
half for burglary and larceny involved persons under 18 years of age.

East Providence should organize its civil defense setup and begin 
by appointing a full-time director, Raymond H& Hawksley, the 
present city ~CD head, believes.   Mr& Hawksley said yesterday 
he would be willing to go before the city council "or anyone 
else locally" to outline his proposal at the earliest possible time.

East Providence now has no civil defense program. Mr& Hawksley, 
the state's general treasurer, has been a part-time ~CD 
director in the city for the last nine years. He is not interested in 
being named a full-time director.   Noting that President Kennedy 
has handed the Defense Department the major responsibility for 
the nation's civil defense program, Mr& Hawksley said the federal 
government would pay half the salary of a full-time local director.

He expressed the opinion the city could hire a ~CD director 
for about $3,500 a year and would only have to put up half that amount 
on 
a matching fund basis to defray the salary costs.   Mr& Hawksley 
said he believed there are a number of qualified city residents 
who would be willing to take the full-time ~CD job. One of these 
men is former Fire Chief John A& Laughlin, he said.   Along 
with a director, the city should provide a ~CD headquarters so 
that pertinent information about the local organization would be centralized. 
Mr& Hawksley said.   One advantage that would come to 
the city in having a full-time director, he said, is that East Providence 
would become eligible to apply to the federal government for financial 
aid in purchasing equipment needed for a sound civil defense 
program.   Matching funds also can be obtained for procurement of 
such items as radios, sirens and rescue trucks, he said.   Mr& 
Hawksley believes that East Providence could use two more rescue 
trucks, similar to the ~CD vehicle obtained several years ago and 
now detailed to the Central Fire Station.   He would assign 
one of the rescue trucks to the Riverside section of the city and the 
other to the Rumford area.   Speaking of the present status of 
civil defense in the city, Mr& Hawksley said he would be willing 
to bet that not more than one person in a hundred would know what to 
do or where to go in the event of an enemy attack.   The Narragansett 
Race Track grounds is one assembly point, he said, and a drive-in 
theater in Seekonk would be another. Riverside residents would 
go to the Seekonk assembly point.   Mr& Hawksley said he was 
not critical of city residents for not knowing what to do or where to 
assemble in case of an air attack.   Such vital information, he 
said, has to be made available to the public frequently and at regular 
intervals for residents to know.   If the city council fails to 
consider appointment of a full-time ~CD director, Mr& Hawksley 
said, then he plans to call a meeting early in September so that a 
civil defense organization will be developed locally.   One of 
the first things he would do, he said, would be to organize classes in 
first aid. Other steps would be developed after information drifts down 
to the local level from the federal government.

Rhode Island is going to examine its Sunday sales law with possible 
revisions in mind.   Governor Notte said last night he 
plans to name a committee to make the study and come up with recommendations 
for possible changes in time for the next session of the General 
Assembly.   The governor's move into the so-called "blue 
law" controversy came in the form of a letter to Miss Mary R& 
Grant, deputy city clerk of Central Falls. A copy was released to 
the press.   Mr& Notte was responding to a resolution adopted 
by the Central Falls City Council on July 10 and sent to the state 
house by Miss Grant. The resolution urges the governor to have a 
complete study of the Sunday sales laws made with an eye to their revision 
at the next session of the legislature.   While the city 
council suggested that the Legislative Council might perform the review, 
Mr& Notte said that instead he will take up the matter with Atty& 
Gen& J& Joseph Nugent to get "the benefit of his views". 
He will then appoint the study committee with Mr& Nugent's 
cooperation, the governor said.   "I would expect the proposed 
committee to hold public hearings", Mr& Notte said, "to obtain 
the views of the general public and religious, labor and special-interest 
groups affected by these laws".   The governor wrote 
Miss Grant that he has been concerned for some time "with the continuous 
problem which confronts our local and state law enforcement officers 
as a result of the laws regulating Sunday sales".   The 
attorney general has advised local police that it is their duty to enforce 
the blue laws. Should there be evidence they are shirking, he has 
said, the state police will step into the situation.   There 
has been more activity across the state line in Massachusetts than in 
Rhode Island in recent weeks toward enforcement of the Sunday sales 
laws. The statutes, similar in both the Bay State and Rhode Island 
and dating back in some instances to colonial times, severely limit 
the types of merchandise that may be sold on the Sabbath.   The 
Central Falls City Council expressed concern especially that more 
foods be placed on the eligible list and that neighborhood grocery 
and variety stores be allowed to do business on Sunday.   The only 
day they "have a chance to compete with large supermarkets is on 
Sunday", the council's resolution said. The small shops "must 
be retained, for they provide essential service to the community", 
according to the resolution, which added that they "also are the source 
of livelihood for thousands of our neighbors". It declares that 
Sunday sales licenses provide "great revenue" to the local government.

The council advised the governor that "large supermarkets, 
factory outlets and department stores not be allowed to do business" 
on Sunday. They "operate on a volume basis", it was contended,
