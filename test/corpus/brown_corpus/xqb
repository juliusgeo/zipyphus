and leaned back on a chaise and considered pulling her thoughts together. 
After a time, it occurred to her that her thoughts were not worth 
the trouble. A vague feeling that Anthony Payne had had it coming 
was hardly a thought and was, in any event, reprehensible. Had Faith 
Constable's explanation of her confidence, so uninvited, been a 
little thin? That was more like a thought, but not a great deal more. 
Had that tall dark boy, carrying trays too heavy for him, found what 
he might have considered adulation of a man he probably hated more 
than he could bear? And possessed himself- how?- of a rifle 
and killed? Pam found she had no answers; had only a hope. The poor 
kid- the poor, frail kid. Some people have luck and some have no 
luck and that, whatever people who prefer order say, is the size of 
it. The poor, unlucky-   The telephone rang. Pam realized, to 
her surprise, that she had been almost dozing. At four o'clock in 
the afternoon. Two martinis for lunch- that was the trouble. I ought 
to remember. Don't pretend. You do remember. You just- "Hello? 
Yes, this is she? What"?   The voice had music 
in it. Even with words coming too fast, they came on the music of the 
voice.   "I said I would", Pam said. "They won't talk 
about who gave the information. Not unless they have to. They don't, 
Mrs& Constable. Not unless they have"-   She was 
interrupted.   "Call this a cry for help", Faith Constable 
said. 
"Through a door conveniently unlocked", Madden supplemented.

"That damn door", said the police chief.   "A gift horse 
to be viewed with suspicion". Madden's dark face wore a meditative 
look. "If there was collusion between an outside murderer and 
a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check 
on the door later. And it makes a very poor red herring for an inside 
job. Much better to break a cellar window".   "Don't 
forget, there was the hope it would pass for a natural death", Pauling 
reminded him.   "Well, with a house as big as that there 
must be at least one cellar window that wouldn't be noticed right away 
unless there was a police investigation".   "Yeah. And a 
pane of glass isn't hard to"-   The telephone interrupted 
him. He scooped up the receiver and said, "Police chief", into 
the mouthpiece, and then, "Oh yes, Mr& Benson. I was hoping I'd 
hear from you today".   With his free hand he pulled a pad 
and pencil toward him and began to make notes as he listened, saying, 
"Uh-huh" and "I see" at intervals.   At last he said, 
"Well, thank you for calling, Mr& Benson. Although there was 
no doubt in my mind and we've been handling it as one I'm glad 
to have it made official".   He hung up. "Coroner", he said 
to Madden. "He's just heard from the pathologist who says Mrs& 
Meeker apparently died from suffocation". Pauling looked at his 
notes. "Many minute hemorrhages in the lungs; particles of lint 
and thread in the mouth and nostrils. Scrapings from the bed linen 
identical with the lint and thread found in the nasal and oral cavities. 
No other cause of death apparent. Trachea clear of mucus and foreign 
objects. Brain examined for thrombosis, clot or hemorrhage. No signs 
of these, no gross hemorrhage of lungs, heart, brain or stomach". 
He paused. "That's about it. Oh, the time of death. The duration 
of the digestive process varies, the pathologist says, but the empty 
stomach and the findings in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate 
that Mrs& Meeker died several hours after her seven-o'clock 
dinner. Probably around midnight, give or take an hour either way".

Pauling paused again. "So there it is", he said. "Not 
your problem, of course, unless Johnston and the murderer are one 
and the same".   They discussed this possibility. However likely 
it was, Pauling said, he couldn't limit himself to it. He had 
to look for other prospects, other motives until more conclusive evidence 
pointing to Johnston came to light. Madden, with his investigation 
centered on the fraud, said that tomorrow he would go to the Bronx 
bank through which Mrs& Meeker's checks to Johnston had cleared.

Arthur Williams had to be located, they agreed. He might 
have been in collusion with Johnston on the fraud; he might be Mrs& 
Meeker's murderer or have played some part in her death. This 
was Madden's suggestion; the police chief shook his head over it. 
If Arthur Williams was involved in the fraud or the murder, then he 
too had another identity. No one the Medfield police had questioned 
professed to know any more about him than about Johnston.   Scholarship 
applicant? Pauling looked doubtful. Madden explained that 
he was thinking of an application sent directly to Mrs& Meeker. 
Then he asked to use the phone and called Brian Thayer, who said that 
he was just leaving to keep a lunch date but would be home by two 
o'clock.   Madden said that he would see him at two and made another 
call, this one to Mrs& Meeker's lawyers. Mr& Hohlbein 
was out for the day, but Mr& Garth would be free at one-thirty. The 
secretary's tone indicated that an appointment at such short notice 
was a concession for which Madden should be duly grateful. 
He inferred that Hohlbein and Garth were high-priced lawyers.

He had lunch with Pauling. Promptly at one-thirty he entered Hohlbein 
and Garth's elegant suite of offices in Medfield's newest 
professional building.   He disliked Garth on sight, conservative 
clothes and haircut, smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man 
who must be well into his thirties, handclasp too consciously quick and 
firm. Youngish man on the make, Madden labeled him, and was ready 
to guess that in a correct, not too pushing fashion, the junior partner 
of the firm had political ambitions; that Mrs& Garth would be 
impeccably suitable as the wife of a rising young lawyer; that there 
were three children, two boys and a girl; that she was active in the 
Woman's Club and he in Lions, Rotary, and Jaycee; and finally, 
that neither of them had harbored an unorthodox opinion since their 
wedding day.   Madden knew that he could be completely wrong about 
all this, but also knew that he would go right on disliking Garth.

Garth was prepared to be helpful in what he referred to with 
fastidious distaste as this unfortunate Johnston affair, which would 
not, he said more than once, have ever come about if Mrs& Meeker 
had only seen fit to consult Mr& Hohlbein or him about it. 
Madden regretted not being able to find fault with so true a statement. 
He asked to see a copy of Mrs& Meeker's will.   Garth 
brought one out.   The date, October 8, 1957, immediately caught 
the inspector's eye. "Fairly recent", he remarked. "Was she 
in the habit of making new wills"?   "Oh no. She had reason 
to change the one she made right after Mr& Meeker's death. Her 
estate had grown considerably. She wanted to make a more equitable 
distribution of it among the groups that would benefit the most; particularly 
the scholarship fund. At the time the will was drawn Mr& 
Hohlbein mentioned to me how mentally alert she seemed for her age, 
knowing just what changes she wanted made and so forth".   Garth 
hesitated. "Mr& Hohlbein and I have noticed some lapses since, 
though. Most of them this past year, I'd say. Even two or three 
years ago I doubt that she'd have become involved in this unfortunate 
Johnston affair. She'd have consulted us, you see. She always 
did before, and showed the utmost confidence in whatever we advised".

The inspector nodded, doubting this. Mrs& Meeker hadn't 
struck him as ready to seek anyone's advise, least of all Garth's. 
With her sharp tongue she'd have cut his pompousness to ribbons. 
It would have been Hohlbein who handled her affairs.   Madden 
settled back to read the will.   He skimmed over the millions 
that went to Meeker Park, Medfield Hospital, the civic center, 
the Public Health Nursing Association, the library, and so on, pausing 
when he came to the scholarship fund. Two millions were added to 
what had been set aside for it in Mrs& Meeker's lifetime, and 
the proviso made that as long as Brian Thayer continued to discharge 
his duties as administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board 
of trustees (hereinafter appointed by the bank administering the estate) 
he was to be retained in his present capacity at a salary commensurate 
with the increased responsibilities enlargement of the fund would 
entail.   A splendid vote of confidence in Thayer, Madden 
reflected. Tenure, too. Very nice for him.   He went on to personal 
bequests, a list of names largely unknown to him. Twenty-five thousand 
to each of the great-nieces in Oregon (not much to blood relatives 
out of millions) ten thousand to this friend and that, five thousand 
to another; to Brian Thayer, the sum of ten thousand dollars; 
to the Pecks, ten thousand each; to Joan Sheldon the conditional 
bequest of ten thousand to be paid to her in the event that she was 
still in Mrs& Meeker's employ at the time of the latter's death. 
(No additional five thousand for each year after Joan's twenty-first 
birthday; Mrs& Meeker hadn't got around to taking care 
of that.)   Too bad, Madden thought. Joan Sheldon had earned 
the larger bequest.   Mr& Hohlbein was left twenty thousand, 
Garth ten. There were no other names Madden recognized. Arthur Williams's 
might well have been included, he felt. Mrs& Meeker had 
spent a small fortune on a search for him but had made no provision for 
him in her will if he should be found after her death, and had never 
mentioned his name to her lawyers.   Madden took up this point 
with Garth, who shrugged it off. "Old people have their idiosyncrasies".

"This one came a bit high at thirty thousand or more".

"Well, she had a number of them where money was concerned", 
Garth said. "Sometimes we'd have trouble persuading her to 
make tax-exempt charitable contributions, and I've known her to quarrel 
with a plumber over a bill for fixing a faucet; the next moment 
she'd put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty 
thousand into something as impractical as this unfortunate Johnston 
affair. There was no telling how she'd react to spending money".

Madden inquired next about the audit of the scholarship fund.

There was an annual audit, Garth informed him. No discrepancies 
or shortages had ever been found. Brian Thayer was a thoroughly 
honest and competent administrator. His salary had reached the ten thousand 
mark. His expenses ran another four or five thousand. The lawyer 
didn't know him very well although he saw him occasionally at some 
dinner party- Thayer, like himself, Madden reflected, was the extra 
man so prized by hostesses- and found him easy enough to talk to. 
But he didn't play golf, didn't seem to belong to any local clubs- 
his work took him away a lot, of course- which probably accounted 
for his tendency to keep to himself.   Garth's glance began 
to flicker to his watch.   He said that he had already told the 
police chief that he didn't know what insurance man had recommended 
Johnston to Mrs& Meeker. He would offer no theory to account 
for her murder. The whole thing, his manner conveyed, was so far outside 
the normal routine of Hohlbein and Garth that it practically demanded 
being swept under the rug.   No doubt Mrs& Meeker had 
snubbed him many a time and he felt no grief over her passing. Even so, 
Madden's dislike of the suave, correct lawyer deepened. It would 
be all right with him, he decided, if his investigation of the fraud, 
with its probable by-product of murder, led to Garth's door. Motive? 
Ten-thousand-dollar bequest. At first glance, not much of a motive 
for a man of his standing; but for all his air of affluence, who 
could tell what his private financial picture was?   The inspector 
knew as he left that this was wishful thinking. Nevertheless, 
he made a mental note to look into Garth's financial background.

Brian Thayer had a downtown address. He lived in an apartment 
house not over three or four years old, a reclaimed island of landscaped 
brick and glass on the fringe of the business district.   He 
occupied a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor, using the second 
bedroom as his office. Airy and bright, the apartment was furnished 
with good modern furniture, rugs, and draperies. Done by a professional 
decorator, Madden thought, and somehow as impersonal, as unremarkable
