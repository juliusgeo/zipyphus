say anything, trying to get my throat clear, but I watched him. 
He was like a mean horse to come at from the rear. It was better, though, 
he'd hit me. He was bitter when he missed.   "Get the 
hell out of here".   "Big Hans sent me. He told me to wake 
you".   "A fat hell on Big Hans. Get out of here".

"He found the Pedersen kid by the crib".   "Get the 
hell out".   Pa pulled at the covers. He was tasting his mouth.

"The kid's froze good. Hans is rubbing him with snow. 
He's got him in the kitchen".   "Pedersen"? 
"No, Pa. It's the Pedersen kid. The kid".   "Nothing 
to steal from the crib".   "Not stealing, Pa. He was just 
lying there. Hans found him froze. That's where he was when Hans 
found him".   Pa laughed.   "I ain't hid nothing in 
the crib".   "You don't understand, Pa. The Pedersen 
kid. The kid"-   "I god damn well understand".   Pa 
had his head up, glaring, his teeth gnawing at the place where he'd 
grown a mustache once.   "I god damn well understand. You 
know I don't want to see Pedersen. That cock. Why should I? What 
did he come for, hey? God dammit, get. And don't come back. 
Find out something. You're a fool. Both you and Hans. Pedersen. 
That cock. Don't come back. Out. Out".   He was shouting 
and breathing hard and closing his fist on the pillow. He had long 
black hairs on his wrist. They curled around the cuff of his nightshirt.

"Big Hans made me come. Big Hans said"-   "A 
fat hell on Big Hans. He's an even bigger fool than you are. 
Fat, hey? I taught him, dammit, and I'll teach you. Out. You 
want me to drop my pot"?   He was about to get up so I got 
out, slamming the door. He was beginning to see he was too mad to sleep. 
Then he threw things. Once he went after Hans and dumped his pot 
over the banister. Pa'd been shit-sick in that pot. Hans got an 
axe. He didn't even bother to wipe himself off and he chopped part 
of Pa's door down before he stopped. He might not have gone that 
far if Pa hadn't been locked in laughing fit to shake the house. 
That pot put Pa in an awful good humor whenever he thought of it. I 
always felt the memory was present in both of them, stirring in their 
chests like a laugh or a growl, as eager as an animal to be out. I 
heard Pa cursing all the way downstairs.   Hans had laid steaming 
towels over the kid's chest and stomach. He was rubbing snow on 
the kid's legs and feet. Water from the snow and water from the towels 
had run off the kid to the table where the dough was, and the dough 
was turning pasty, sticking to the kid's back and behind.   "Ain't 
he going to wake up"?   "What about your pa"?

"He was awake when I left".   "What'd he say? 
Did you get the whisky"?   "He said a fat hell on Big 
Hans".   "Don't be smart. Did you ask him about the whisky"?

"Yeah".   "Well"?   "He said 
a fat hell on Big Hans".   "Don't be smart. What's 
he going to do"?   "Go back to sleep most likely".

"You'd best get that whisky".   "You go. Take the axe. 
Pa's scared to hell of axes".   "Listen to me, Jorge, 
I've had enough to your sassing. This kid's froze bad. If I don't 
get some whisky down him he might die. You want the kid to die? 
Do you? Well, get your pa and get that whisky".   "Pa 
don't care about the kid".   "Jorge".   "Well 
he don't. He don't care at all, and I don't care to get my head 
busted neither. He don't care, and I don't care to have his shit 
flung on me. He don't care about anybody. All he cares about is 
his whisky and that dry crack in his face. Get pig-drunk- that's 
what he wants. He don't care about nothing else at all. Nothing. 
Not Pedersen's kid neither. That cock. Not the kid neither".

"I'll get the spirits", Ma said.   I'd wound Big 
Hans up tight. I was ready to jump but when Ma said she'd get the 
whisky it surprised him like it surprised me, and he ran down. Ma 
never went near the old man when he was sleeping it off. Not any more. 
Not for years. The first thing every morning when she washed her face 
she could see the scar on her chin where he'd cut her with a boot 
cleat, and maybe she saw him heaving it again, the dirty sock popping 
out as it flew. It should have been nearly as easy for her to remember 
that as it was for Big Hans to remember going after the axe while 
he was still spattered with Pa's yellow sick insides.   "No 
you won't", Big Hans said.   "Yes, Hans, if they're 
needed", 
Ma said.   Hans shook his head but neither of us tried 
to stop her. If we had, then one of us would have had to go instead. 
Hans rubbed the kid with more snow **h rubbed **h rubbed.   "I'll 
get more snow", I said. I took the pail and shovel and went 
out on the porch. I don't know where Ma went. I thought she'd 
gone upstairs and expected to hear she had. She had surprised Hans 
like she had surprised me when she said she'd go, and then she surprised 
him again when she came back so quick like she must have, because 
when I 
came in with the snow she was there with a bottle with three 
white feathers on its label and Hans was holding it angrily by the throat.

Oh, he was being queer and careful, pawing about in the 
drawer and holding the bottle like a snake at the length of his arm. 
He was awful angry because he'd thought Ma was going to do something 
big, something heroic even, especially for her **h I know him **h 
I know him **h we felt the same sometimes **h while Ma wasn't thinking 
about 
that at all, not anything like that. There was no way of getting 
even. It wasn't like getting cheated at the fair. They were always 
trying so you got to expect it. Now Hans had given Ma something of 
his- we both had when we thought she was going straight to Pa- 
something valuable; but since she didn't know we'd given it to her, 
there was no easy way of getting it back.   Hans cut the foil 
off finally and unscrewed the cap. He was put out too because there 
was only one way of understanding what she'd done. Ma had found one 
of Pa's hiding places. She'd found one and she hadn't said a 
word while Big Hans and I had hunted and hunted as we always did all 
winter, every winter since the spring that Hans had come and I had 
looked in the privy and found the first one. Pa had a knack for hiding. 
He knew we were looking and he enjoyed it. But now Ma. She'd 
found it by luck most likely but she hadn't said anything and we didn't 
know how long ago it'd been or how many other ones she'd found, 
saying nothing. Pa was sure to find out. Sometimes he didn't 
seem to because he hid them so well he couldn't find them himself or 
because he looked and didn't find anything and figured he hadn't 
hid one after all or had drunk it up. But he'd find out about this 
one because we were using it. A fool could see what was going on. If 
he found out Ma found it- that'd be bad. He took pride in his 
hiding. It was all the pride he had. I guess fooling Hans and me took 
doing. But he didn't figure Ma for much. He didn't figure her 
at all, and if he found out 
**h a woman **h it'd be bad.   Hans 
poured some in a tumbler.   "You going to put more towels on him"?

"No".   "Why not? That's what he needs, 
something warm to his skin, don't he"?   "Not where 
he's froze good. Heat's bad for frostbite. That's why I only 
put towels on his chest and belly. He's got to thaw slow. You ought 
to know that".   Colors on the towels had run.   Ma poked 
her toe in the kid's clothes.   "What are we going to do 
with these"?   Big Hans began pouring whisky in the kid's 
mouth but his mouth filled without any getting down his throat and in 
a second it was dripping from his chin.   "Here, help me prop 
him up. I got hold his mouth open".   I didn't want to touch 
him and I hoped Ma would do it but she kept looking at the kid's 
clothes piled on the floor and the pool of water by them and didn't 
make any move to.   "Come on, Jorge".   "All right".

"Lift, don't shove **h lift".   "O&K&, 
I'm lifting".   I took him by the shoulders. His head flopped 
back. His mouth fell open. The skin on his neck was tight. He 
was cold all right.   "Hold his head up. He'll choke".

"His mouth is open".   "His throat's shut. He'll 
choke".   "He'll choke anyway".   "Hold his 
head up".   "I can't".   "Don't hold him like 
that. Put your arms around him".   "Well Jesus". 
He was cold all right. I put my arm carefully around him. Hans had 
his fingers in the kid's mouth.   "Now he'll choke for sure".

"Shut up. Just hold him like I told you".   He 
was cold all right, and wet. I had my arm behind his back. 
He was in his mid-fifties at this time, long past the establishment of 
his name and the wish to be lionized yet once again, and it was almost 
a decade since he had sworn off lecturing. There was never a doubt 
any more how his structures would be received; it was always the same 
unqualified success now. He could no longer build anything, whether 
a private residence in his Pennsylvania county or a church in Brazil, 
without it being obvious that he had done it, and while here and there 
he was taken to task for again developing the same airy technique, 
they were such fanciful and sometimes even playful buildings that the 
public felt assured by its sense of recognition after a time, a quality 
of authentic uniqueness about them, which, once established by an 
artist as his private vision, is no longer disputable as to its other 
values. Stowey Rummel was internationally famous, a crafter of a genuine 
Americana in foreign eyes, an original designer whose inventive 
childishness with steel and concrete was made even more believably sincere 
by his personality. He had lived for almost thirty years in this 
same stone farmhouse with the same wife, a remarkably childish thing 
in itself; he rose at half-past six every morning, made himself some 
French coffee, had his corn flakes and more coffee, smoked four cigarettes 
while reading last Sunday's <Herald Tribune> and yesterday's 
Pittsburgh <Gazette>, then put on his high-topped farmer's 
shoes and walked under a vine bower to his workshop. This was an enormously 
long building whose walls were made of rocks, some of them brought 
home from every continent during his six years as an oil geologist. 
The debris of his other careers was piled everywhere; a pile of 
wire cages for mice from his time as a geneticist and a microscope lying 
on its side on the window sill, vertical steel columns wired for support 
to the open ceiling beams with spidery steel cantilevers jutting 
out into the air, masonry constructions on the floor from the time he 
was inventing his disastrous fireplace whose smoke would pass through 
a whole house, visible all the way up through wire gratings on each 
floor. His files, desk, drafting board and a high stool formed the only 
clean island in the chaos. Everywhere else his ideas lay or hung in 
visible form: his models, drawings, ten-foot canvases in monochromes 
from his painting days, and underfoot a windfall of broken-backed books 
that looked as though their insides had been ransacked by a maniac. 
Bicycle gear-sets he had once used as the basis of the design for 
the Camden Cycly Company plant hung on a rope in one corner, and over 
his desk, next to several old and dusty hats, was a clean pair of roller 
skates which he occasionally used up and down in front of his house. 
He worked standing, with his left hand in his pocket as though he 
were merely stopping for a moment, sketching with the surprised stare 
of one who was watching another person's hand. Sometimes he would 
grunt softly to some invisible onlooker beside him, sometimes he would 
look stern and moralistic as his pencil did what he disapproved. It 
all seemed- if one could have peeked in at him through one of his windows- 
as though this broken-nosed man with the muscular arms and wrestler's 
neck was merely the caretaker trying his hand at the boss's
