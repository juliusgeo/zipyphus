with the considerations above, made the circular motions of heavenly 
bodies appear an almost directly observed fact.   Additional philosophical 
considerations, advanced notably by Aristotle, supported further 
the circularity principle. By distinguishing superlunary (celestial) 
and sublunary (terrestrial) existence, and reinforcing this with 
the four-element physics of Empedocles, Aristotle came to speak of 
the stars as perfect bodies, which moved in only a perfect way, viz& 
in a perfect circle.   Now what is perfect motion? It must, 
apparently, be motion without termini. Because motion which begins and 
ends at discrete places would (e&g& for Aristotle) be incomplete. 
Circular motion, however, since it is eternal and perfectly continuous, 
lacks termini. It is never motion towards something. Only imcomplete, 
imperfect things move towards what they lack. Perfect, complete 
entities, if they move at all, do not move towards what they lack. 
They move only in accordance with what is in their natures. Thus, circular 
motion is itself one of the essential characteristics of completely 
perfect celestial existence.   To return now to the four-element 
physics, a mixture of muddy, frothy water will, when standing in 
a jar, separate out with earth at the bottom, water on top, and the 
air on top of that. A candle alight in the air directs its flame and 
smoke upwards. This gives a clue to the cosmical order of elements. 
Thus earth has fallen to the center of the universe. It is covered (partly) 
with water, air is atop of that. Pure fire (the stars) is in 
the heavens. When combined with the metaphysical notion that pure forms 
of this universe are best appreciated when least embodied in a material 
substratum, it becomes clear that while earth will be dross on a 
scale of material-formal ratios, celestial bodies will be of a subtle, 
quickened, ethereal existence, in whose embodiment pure form will be 
the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary.

The stars constitute an order of existence different from what 
we encounter on earth. This is clear when one distinguishes the types 
of motion appropriate to both regions. A projectile shot up from earth 
returns rectlinearly to its 'natural' place of rest. But the 
natural condition for the heavenly bodies is neither rest, nor rectilinear 
motion. Being less encumbered by material embodiments they partake 
more of what is divine. Their motion will be eternal and perfect.

Let us re-examine the publicized contrasts between Ptolemaic 
and Copernican astronomy. Bluntly, there never was a Ptolemaic <system> 
of astronomy. Copernicus' achievement was to have <invented> 
systematic astronomy. The <Almagest> and the <Hypotheses> outline 
Ptolemy's conception of his own task as the provision of computational 
tables, independent calculating devices for the prediction 
of future planetary perturbations. Indeed, in the Halma edition of Theon's 
presentation of the <Hypotheses> there is a chart setting 
out (under six distinct headings) otherwise unrelated diagrams for describing 
the planetary motions. No attempt is made by Ptolemy to weld 
into a single scheme (<a la> Aristotle), these independent predicting-machines. 
They all have this in common: the earth is situated 
near the center of the deferent. But that one should superimpose all 
these charts, run a pin through the common point, and then scale each 
planetary deferent larger and smaller (to keep the epicycles from 'bumping'), 
this is contrary to any intention Ptolemy ever expresses. 
He might even suppose the planets to move at infinity. Ptolemy's 
problem is to forecast where, against the inverted bowl of night, some 
particular light will be found at future times. His problem concerns 
longitudes, latitudes, and angular velocities. The distances of these 
points of light is a problem he cannot master, beyond crude conjectures 
as to the orderings of the planetary orbits viewed outward from earth. 
But none of this has prevented scientists, philosophers, and even 
historians of science, from speaking of the Ptolemaic <system,> in 
contrast to the Copernican. This is a mistake. It is engendered by 
confounding the Aristotelian cosmology in the <Almagest> with the 
geocentric astronomy.   Ptolemy recurrently denies that he could 
ever <explain> planetary motion. This is what necessitates the nonsystematic 
character of his astronomy. So when textbooks, like that 
of Baker set out drawings of the 'Ptolemaic System', complete 
with earth in the center and the seven heavenly bodies epicyclically arranged 
on their several deferents, we have nothing but a misleading /20,th-century 
idea of what never existed historically.   It is 
the chief merit in Copernicus' work that all his planetary calculations 
are <interdependent>. He cannot, e&g& compute the retrograde 
arc traveled by Mars, without also making suppositions about the 
earth's own motion. He cannot describe eclipses without entertaining 
some form of 
a three-body problem. In Ptolemaic terms, however, eclipses 
and retrograde motion were <phenomena simpliciter,> to be explained 
directly as possible resultants of epicyclical combinations. In a 
<systematic> astronomy, like that of Copernicus, retrogradations become 
part of the conceptual structure of the system; they are no longer 
a puzzling aspect of intricately variable, local planetary motions.

Another contrast stressed when discussing Ptolemaic vs& 
Copernican astronomy, turns on the idea of <simplicity>. It is often 
stated that Copernican astronomy is 'simpler' than Ptolemaic. 
Some even say that this is the reason for the ultimate acceptance of 
the former. Thus, Margenau remarks: "A large number of unrelated 
epicycles was needed to explain the observations, but otherwise the 
[Ptolemaic] system served well and with quantitative precision. Copernicus, 
by placing the sun at the center of the planetary universe, 
was able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen. 
Historical records indicate that Copernicus was unaware of the 
fundamental aspects of his so-called 'revolution', unaware perhaps 
of its historical importance, he rested content with having produced 
a <simpler> scheme for prediction. As an illustration of the principle 
of simplicity the heliocentric discovery has a peculiar appeal because 
it allows simplicity to be arithmetized; it involves a reduction 
in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen".

Without careful qualification this can be misleading. If in any one 
calculation Ptolemy had had to invoke 83 epicycles <all at once,> 
while Copernicus never required more than one third this number, then 
(in the sense obvious to Margenau) Ptolemaic astronomy would be simpler 
than Copernican. But no single planetary problem ever required 
of Ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time. This, of course, results 
from the non-systematic, 'cellular' character of Ptolemaic 
theory. Calculations within the Copernican framework always raised questions 
about planetary configurations. These could be met only by considering 
the dynamical elements of several planets at one time. This 
is more ambitious than Ptolemy is ever required to be when he faces 
his isolated problems. Thus, in no ordinary sense of 'simplicity' 
is the Ptolemaic theory simpler than the Copernican. The latter required 
juggling several elements simultaneously. This was not simpler 
but much more difficult than exercises within Ptolemy's astronomy.

Analogously, anyone who argues that Einstein's theory of 
gravitation is simpler than Newton's, must say rather more to explain 
how it is that the latter is mastered by student-physicists, while 
the former can be managed (with difficulty) only by accomplished experts.

In a sense, Einstein's theory <is> simpler than Newton's, 
and there is a corresponding sense in which Copernicus' theory 
is simpler than Ptolemy's. But 'simplicity' here refers to 
<systematic simplicity>. The number of primitive ideas in systematically-simple 
theories is reduced to a minimum. The axioms required to 
make the theoretical machinery operate are set out tersely and powerfully, 
so that all permissible operations within the theory can be traced 
rigorously back to these axioms, rules, and primitive notions. This 
characterizes Euclid's formulation of geometry, but not Ptolemy's 
astronomy. There are in the <Almagest> no rules for determining 
<in advance> whether a new epicycle will be required for dealing with 
abberations in lunar, solar, or planetary behavior. The strongest 
appeal of the Copernican formulation consisted in just this: ideally, 
the justification for dealing with special problems in particular 
ways is completely set out in the basic 'rules' of the theory. The 
lower-level hypotheses are never 'ad hoc', never introduced <ex 
post facto> just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant datum. 
Copernicus, to an extent unachieved by Ptolemy, approximated to 
Euclid's vision. <De Revolutionibus> is not just a collection of 
facts and techniques. It is an organized system of these things. Solving 
astronomical problems requires, for Copernicus, not a random search 
of unrelated tables, but a regular employment of the rules defining 
the entire discipline.   Hence, noting the simplicity achieved 
in Copernicus' formulation does not provide <another> reason for 
the acceptance of <De Revolutionibus,> another reason beyond its 
systematic superiority. It provides exactly <the same> reason.

1543 A&D& is often venerated as the birthday of the scientific 
revolution. It is really the funeral day of scholastic science. Granted, 
the cosmological, philosophical, and cultural reverberations 
initiated by the <De Revolutionibus> were felt with increasing violence 
during the 300 years to follow. But, considered within technical 
astronomy, a different pattern can be traced.   In what does the 
dissatisfaction of Copernicus-the-astronomer consist? What in the 
<Almagest> draws his fire? Geocentricism <per se?> No. The 
formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from being Copernicus' 
<primary> concern, was introduced only to resolve what seemed 
to him intolerable in orthodox astronomy, namely, the 'unphysical' 
triplication of centric reference-points: one center from which 
the planet's distances were calculated, another around which planetary 
velocities were computed, and still a third center (the earth) from 
which the observations originated. This arrangement was for Copernicus 
literally monstrous: "With [the Ptolemaists] it is as though 
an artist were to gather the hands, feet, head and other members 
for his images from divers models, each part excellently drawn, but not 
related to a single body; and since they in no way match each other, 
the result would be a monster rather than a man".   Copernicus 
required a systematically integrated, physically intelligible astronomy. 
His objective was, essentially, to repair those aspects of orthodox 
astronomy responsible for its deficiencies in achieving these ends. 
That such deficiencies existed within Ptolemy's theory was not 
discovered <de novo> by Copernicus. The critical, rigorous examinations 
of Nicholas of Cusa and Nicholas of Oresme provided the context 
(a late medieval context) for Nicholas Copernicus' own work. 
The latter looked backward upon inherited deficiencies. Without abandoning 
too much, Copernicus sought to make orthodox astronomy systematically 
and mechanically acceptable. He did not think himself to be 
firing the first shot of an intellectual revolution.
