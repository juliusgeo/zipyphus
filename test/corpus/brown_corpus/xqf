the end of its lines until its bow was pointing into the wind and the 
cockpit faced toward the shore. Nick watched her somewhat enviously as 
she efficiently cut the engines, and started the auxiliary motor.

Poet came up from below, wearing new bathing trunks. The price 
tag hung from the belt and he pulled it off as he entered the chartroom 
and looked at it curiously. Nick wondered if Elaine had bought them, 
but he said nothing. Nobody, he suddenly realized, was saying anything. 
It seemed as if they were all under a spell. There should be an 
excited conversation, for somewhere, directly below them, was a treasure 
lost for more than four hundred years.   But instead of chatter 
there was a null, like on the radio direction finder. Once, in New 
York, he had gone flying with some friends in a small private airplane 
with a single engine. They had all been laughing, joking, when 
suddenly the engine had failed. No one had screamed. No one had prayed. 
All had fallen into a complete silence, listening to the wind whistle 
over the wings. The pilot had been good. He'd landed the plane 
on a small airstrip in Connecticut and as soon as the aircraft had 
coasted to a stop, everyone had burst into chatter at the same moment.

There had been tension in the plane during the silent descent; 
a tension similar to the one now. But in the plane there was a concrete 
reason for it. Now, at this moment, there should be none **h unless 
skin diving was much more dangerous than he had been led to believe. 
Yet tension existed. The same taut-nerved relationship as there 
had been between the passengers on the plane now strained at the three 
of them here on the boat. It hung over them like a cloud, its arrival 
as sudden as a cloud skidding over the sun.   Silently, Elaine 
picked up her keys from the table and went out into the cockpit, Poet 
behind her, Nick trailing behind him. She threw back a cushion over 
one of the seats, unlocked a padlock on the chest beneath it, then 
presently straightened, holding a long knife and a wicked looking spear 
gun in her hand.   Poet whistled softly as he looked at the gun. 
"Hydraulic"? he asked.   Elaine nodded. "They are the 
best". She kicked the locker lid shut and replaced the cushion. 
"They are the most efficient".   "And the deadliest", Poet 
commented as he buckled on his tank harness.   "Why do you 
need an arsenal"? Nick asked, apprehensively, staring at the weapon.

"It's quite possible there's more than codfish down 
there, man", Poet replied with a short, nervous laugh as he held 
the harness for Elaine.   A moment later, moving awkwardly because 
of the swimming fins, she picked up the gun, handed the knife to Poet, 
then rolled off the transom of the boat, back first. Poet nodded 
to Nick and entered the water in a similar fashion. Another moment 
and they were out of sight, leaving behind only a string of bubbles as 
a clue to their whereabouts.   For a while Nick followed the 
twisting course of the bubbles, wondering which set came from Elaine. 
They remained close together, their air trail wiggling like serpents 
traveling side by side. Eventually the bubbles became lost in the sparkle 
of the ocean surface, and he rolled over on his back.   Clasping 
his hands behind his head, he stared at the blue sky. There was 
nothing quite like being alone on a boat on the ocean. Alfredo certainly 
must have enjoyed being alone. Next to the ocean, probably the 
loneliest spot was the desert. If Elaine's uncle had stuck to this 
desire for aloneness, he probably would still be alive.   Yet Alfredo 
wanted money **h wanted money to roam through the deserts. And 
Graham wanted money probably to roam among the dice tables in Las 
Vegas. It was an odd combination **h a strange pair to stumble upon 
the wreck of the <Trinidad>. But Graham hadn't stumbled on it. 
Two to three weeks prior to the charter of the <Virginia>, Graham 
had been snooping around the San Luis Rey Mission.   The small 
helicopter with its two steel skids churned offshore and Nick raised 
up to watch it heading south. That was a hell of a note, he thought. 
A couple couldn't even find a secluded spot anywhere on a beach 
to neck nowadays without someone swooping down upon them. If the character 
flying that thing had gone over San Clemente Island yesterday 
he would have had an eyeful.   Off to the west a beautiful schooner 
slowly beat its way into the wind, headed on a tack toward San 
Clemente. Behind it a cabin cruiser drifted crossways in the small 
ground-swell, a lone fisherman in the chair aft. The fisherman was right 
in the middle of the Deep. Nick recalled stories that the two best 
fishing spots in Southern California were over the La Jolla Deep 
and the Redondo Deep, two spots where the ocean dropped off to fantastic 
depths almost from the shoreline.   Someday, geologists 
had warned, the land on both sides of these deeps would fall into the 
ocean and no more La Jolla or Redondo Beach. Meanwhile, fishermen 
took advantage of them to pull up whoppers. Sometimes the fish exploded 
as they neared the surface because of the difference in pressure.

Why, he wondered, had Elaine wanted him along on this trip? 
He couldn't skindive, he couldn't run a boat, except on the open 
sea. He stood up, stretched, looked around for the bubbles, but could 
see none. Strolling down to the galley, he lit the butane under the 
coffee pot and when the brew was heated, poured himself a cup and went 
up to the chartroom. Turning on the hi-fi, he went back to the cockpit, 
stretched out on the cushions and listened to the music.   Elaine 
and Poet returned together, popping up over the transom almost 
like dolphins breaking water.   He sat up and watched as they pulled 
themselves over the stern. "Any luck"? he asked.   Poet 
shook his head, sliding his face mask up on his forehead. 
"We're right on the edge of the Deep", Elaine said. Pulling 
off her face mask, she carefully placed the spear gun across the stern, 
then lifted her wet hair from her back and squeezed out the water. "Which 
is a break as the area to search is less than a square mile", 
she added as she swung her legs over the transom. "Any news"?

"Not a thing". He tossed her a towel, then repeated the 
service for Poet. "Cigarette"?   Elaine shook her head 
as she slipped out of her harness, but Poet nodded. His feet still hung 
over the stern of the transom, but as he reached for the smoke he 
raised them to swing them in. The fin on his foot caught on the moulding, 
throwing him off balance. His forearm smashed painfully into the 
narrow washboard and he grimaced as he grabbed his bruised limb with 
his other hand and rolled into the boat.   "Kee-reist"! The 
word hissed distinctly from Poet's lips as he struggled to his feet.

Nick's body became rigid. Turning slowly he saw Poet 
in a brilliant glare of horror. Poet! His face was still creased in 
pain as he studied the underside of his arm. Poet a murderer? Turning 
quickly toward Elaine, Nick saw that she, too, stood in shocked 
surprise.   The sudden silence was too silent. Instinctively 
aware of the charged atmosphere, Poet raised his head slowly, looking 
first at Elaine.   She had caught the implication of the oath. 
Her face was frozen into the mask of a mannequin, her body absolutely 
motionless.   And then Nick knew that all of them knew **h Elaine, 
himself **h and Poet.   Elaine recovered first, so quickly 
that Nick thought he might have imagined her sudden reaction. "Do 
you need a bandage"? she asked steadily.   Poet rubbed 
his arm. "It's like banging a shin", he said, his eyes lingered 
on Nick's face, then moved back to Elaine. "Hurts like hell for 
a second, then it disappears".   "I'll get some ointment". 
Elaine turned and started toward the companionway. But her walk 
was too steady, too slow, telegraphing her fear.   Nick sensed 
it. So did Poet. Springing like a cat, he leaped back, swooped up the 
spring gun and, whirling, pointed it toward the cabin. At the same 
instant, Nick hit the barrel and threw himself upon the smaller man. 
The gun fired next to his ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke 
of an old steam engine. At the same instant, Elaine screamed wildly, 
the sound ending abruptly as Nick went off the boat and into the 
water on top of the frantic, struggling Poet.   The moment the 
sea closed over Nick, some atavistic sense warned him that he would 
survive in this alien element only if he did not panic. But the murderer 
to whom he clung had a tremendous advantage. The wide flippers 
on Poet's feet gave his legs incredible power, driving the two of them 
down into the water as they rolled over and over. Poet was the captured, 
arms pinioned to his side, and he twisted convulsively trying 
to escape. Poet would escape, Nick thought grimly, because he wore the 
apparatus which would keep him alive under water. But Nick would 
not let go.   The rubber and glass face mask slipped from Poet's 
forehead, bounced painlessly off Nick's chin, then disappeared. 
Poet twisted again and Nick's knuckles scraped on the air tank, ripping 
off the skin. For a split second, Nick relaxed his grip and Poet's 
slippery body spun completely around before Nick could stop 
him, holding him now from the rear. Something flailed at the side of 
Nick's head as they rolled around and around.   Suddenly Poet 
stopped struggling and the two of them hung suspended in the water, 
not rising, not sinking. A sharp pain lanced across Nick's chest and 
a bubble of air escaped from his tortured lungs, joining dozens of 
others that sailed lazily toward the surface like helium balloons rising 
into the sky. A black, snake-like object swayed eerily in front of 
him, spewing bubbles from its flat cobra head. The air hose was free! 
The discovery struck Nick like a blow.   Desperately, Nick 
flashed one hand up, catching Poet's neck in the bend of his elbow. 
At the same instant, he grabbed the loose, writhing hose with his 
other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece. Instinctively 
he exhaled through his nose then sucked in the air from the hose. At 
once the excruciating pain in his chest stopped and he was seized with 
a sudden, wild exultation.   As if this was a signal, Poet abruptly 
began to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly made them 
sink through the water. Relentlessly, Nick held on, sucking on the 
hose, inhaling the air that belonged to Poet. Poet was not fighting 
Nick now.

HARBOR POINT sticks out into the ocean like the fat neck 
of a steamer clam. It's a rich village but not much for action- too 
many solid residents, not enough tourists or working stiffs. It's 
at the far end of the county and the last time I came here was for 
a hit and run manslaughter- about seven months ago.   Chief Bob 
Moore looked his same hick-self; a man mountain running to lard 
in his middle-age. Seeing me he said with real surprise, "Well, well, 
ain't we honored! Hardly expected the <head> of County Homicide 
up for this murder. You sure climbed fast, Jed. Rookie investigator 
last summer and now it's <Inspector Jed>. Took me 19 years 
to become Chief of our three man police force. Proves a college 
education pays off". His sarcasm was followed by a stupid grin of his 
thick mouth and bad teeth.   "I guess it helps", I said, 
paying no attention to his ribbing.   "Never could figure out 
why you ever wanted to be a cop, Jed. You're not only young but **h 
well, you don't <even look> like a police officer. A runt with 
narrow shoulders and that brush haircut **h hell, you'd pass for a 
juvenile delinquent of the hotrod set. In my day the first requirement 
for a cop was to look like the law, big and tough. Man, when my 275 
pounds and six-four comes along, why it's the same as another badge. 
When I say move, a guy moves"!   "Don't worry about 
my being tough, Moore. Also, it's far too early in the day for corny 
lines like the bigger they come **h You've had your gassy lecture, 
let's get to work. Who was the murdered woman **h Mrs& Buck"?

"Widow, nice sort of woman. Comfortably fixed. Ran a 
fair-sized farm. Came to the Harbor as a bride and **h Don't worry 
Jed, this one is in the bag. I know the killer, have the only road 
off the peninsula covered".   "Yeah, passed your road block 
as I drove in", I said, sitting on his polished desk. Although 
Bob dressed like a slob, he kept a neat office. "Okay, what happened"?

"About nine this morning Mrs& Buck phones me she's 
having trouble with one of her farm hands- money trouble. Colored 
fellow named Tim Williams- only hand she has working for her 
now. Tim come with the migratory workers that follow the crops up from
